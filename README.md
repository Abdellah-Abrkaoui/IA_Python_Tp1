# Exercise 1:
In this exercise, we write a Python program that allows the user to input three grades (ranging from 0 to 20) of a student. The program then calculates the average grade and displays it along with a corresponding mention such as "Excellent" for grades 16 and above, "Good" for grades between 14 and 16, and so on.

# Exercise 2:
For this task, we develop a Python program that displays the solutions of a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.

# Exercise 3:
The Python program in this exercise prompts the user to input a time T in seconds and converts it into hours, minutes, and seconds format.

# Exercise 4:
We create a Python program to solve a taxation problem for the residents of a city. The program prompts the user for the age and gender of a resident and determines if they are liable to pay taxes based on certain rules.

# Exercise 5:
In this exercise, we implement a Python program that prompts the user for two integers and an operator (+, -, *, /) and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation, displaying the result.

# Exercise 6:
1. The first part of this exercise involves writing a Python program that asks the user for a starting number and then displays the next ten numbers using a For loop.
2. The second part requires using a While loop to achieve the same task.

# Exercise 7:
Our Python program for this exercise reads a non-zero integer 'n' and calculates the sum of the first 'n' squares.

# Exercise 8:
We develop a Python program to compute and display the sum: S = 1 + 10 + 100 + ... + 10^n.

# Exercise 9:
The Python program for this exercise checks if a given integer 'n' is a perfect number or not, displaying the result accordingly.

# Exercise 10:
1. We create a Python program that reads an array of size 10 and determines if it is sorted in ascending order.
2. Additionally, we suggest a Python program that initializes two vectors belonging to R of size N and displays their scalar product.
